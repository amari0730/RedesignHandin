        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose behind this project was to redesign a website, using proper design principles, to ensure 
            that website is more accessible and comfortable for the user. For this project I had chosen my high scool, website.
            Although the design of the website was already good, I wanted to redesign this website out 
            of nostalgia and wanting to give back to my community.
        </p>
        <h4>Original Site</h4>
        <p>
            The original website is well designed. It's black and white color scheme allows for a more appropriate contrast, which 
            could be useful for users with visual problems. However, I do think that this color scheme is bland. I also think that the links
            were a little difficult to see and use. The seemed to be located at the top of the page and were not 'sticky' (followed the user down
            the page)

        <p>
            For the majority of this redesign I wanted to utalize the color scheme to draw the users attention better. TO ensure that the buttons stood out 
            when they are being hovered, or that when the different sections of the website stood out. I also used a contextualized approach when addressing
            the website. In other words, I ensured that the website would look and act like a normal website. This includes adding links to the top of the
            webpage and as i said before, ensuring that each section, including the header had its proper distinctions. 
        </p>
        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>
            The lesson I learned from this site is that ultmately redesigning a website for a site that is already accessible
            and properly follows design principles is difficult. Ultimately redesigning this website seemed nonsensical. 
            However, I did enjoy making the website and I learned a lot about the application of design principles.
